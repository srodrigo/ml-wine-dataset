How to detect outliers better?

[OK] Convert main.py into visualization.py. Have files for different steps? Such as one for data manipulation, another one for models trial, another one for the final model, etc
Actually, is it better to have different scripts for different experiments? probably... Does this mean that we should have visualisation for each experiment, or maybe not? Probably just for some of them...

[OK] Add a volume to store results

[OK] Perform feature selection

Try feature scaling

Try to apply PCA to see relationships in the data?

[OK] Create run.sh that gives numerical options to run different Python scripts
